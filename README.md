# 8ackW3ak
Official implementation of our paper.


## Datasets Adopted

* CIFAR-10: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html  
* CINIC-10: https://github.com/BayesWatch/cinic-10?tab=readme-ov-file#download  
  * Label mapping (lexicographical order): `airplane` -> `0`, `automobile` -> `1`, `bird` -> `2`, `cat` -> `3`, `deer` -> `4`, `dog` -> `5`, `frog` -> `6`, `horse` -> `7`, `ship` -> `8`, `truck` -> `9`
* ImageNet subset with 50 classes: https://huggingface.co/datasets/SomeBottle/imagenet_50_224x224 
<!--* Balanced GTSRB: https://huggingface.co/datasets/SomeBottle/GTSRB_224x224_balanced -->


## Environment

All our experiments were conducted on a single RTX 4090 GPU, within a Docker container. The image we used is provided below:  

* [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/somebottle/jupyter-torch)  
* [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/SomeBottle/8a75d490d2616ecfe100e676564ac769) ◄ Dockerfile and some tips.

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies in your own Python environment with:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Try It Out

In this section, we provide a quick guide to run some example experiments using our Docker image.

<details>

<summary><b>LINK START</b> ( •̀ ω •́ )✧ </summary>

### 1. Prepare the Environment

First, install Docker with [GPU support](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/gpu-support/) toolkit, and pull the image:

```bash
docker pull somebottle/jupyter-torch:0.0.7
```

Then, start a container with your working directory mounted, ports mapped and password set:

```bash
# If shm-size is not specified, it may easily run out of shared memory when loading data batches with multiple workers. Docker only allocates 64 MiB by default.  
docker run --gpus all -d --restart=unless-stopped --shm-size=16g --env JUPYTER_PASSWORD='EL_PSY_KONGROO' -v <Your working directory>:/app  -p 9527:9527 -p 9528:6006 --name=lab-jupyter somebottle/jupyter-torch:0.0.7
```

Now you can access JupyterLab in your browser at `http://<your_host>:9527` using the password you set (e.g., `EL_PSY_KONGROO` above).

### 2. Prepare Code and Datasets

Upload the code from `./src`, put it anywhere you like **in the container** (`/app` is recommended, as it is the mount we set up earlier), and download the datasets mentioned above.  

By default, the code [assumes](./src/configs/datasets.py#L7) that the datasets are placed in `./datasets`, so just put them there:  

```bash
/app
├── datasets # <-- here
│   ├── cifar-10-batches-py
│   │   ├── batches.meta
│   │   ├── data_batch_1
│   │   ├── data_batch_2
│   │   ...
│   ├── cinic_10
│   │   ├── test
│   │   ├── train
│   │   └── valid
│   └── imagenet_50_224
│       ├── train

├── configs
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── config.py

│   ├── examples
│   ...
├── run_multiple.py
├── run_single_adba.py
├── run_single_backweak.py
├── run_single_scar.py
...
```

### 3. Run Examples

Create a new terminal in the JupyterLab and just have a try:  

```bash
cd /app  # or wherever you put the code

# BackWeak
python run_single_backweak.py -c experiments/examples/VKD_BWCF.toml --od experiment_outputs/ -d cuda:0

# ADBA
python run_single_adba.py -c experiments/examples/FT_ADCF.toml --od experiment_outputs/ -d cuda:0

# OSCAR
python run_single_scar.py -c experiments/examples/RL_OSCF.toml --od experiment_outputs/ -d cuda:0
```

> You can use the `-h` option to view the help message.

### 4. View Logs and Results

You can inspect the **detailed** experiment logs via TensorBoard:   

* Start TensorBoard in the background:  

    ```bash
    screen -dmS tb tensorboard --host=0.0.0.0 --logdir=./tb_logs/
    ```
    > `./tb_logs` is the default TensorBoard logging directory specified in [`./src/configs/config.py`](./src/configs/config.py#L10). 

* Then you can access it at `http://<your_host>:9528` (the default TensorBoard port `6006` has been mapped to the host port `9528`).  

To gather the experimental results, you may go to the output directory you specified (e.g., `experiment_outputs/` in the above commands).  

> 💡 **TIPS**
> To inspect the logs of a specific component during an experiment, you may check the experiment outputs and find the corresponding `id`:  
> ![find_exp_id](./pics/find_exp_id.png)  
>
> Then, you can filter the logs in TensorBoard using this `id`:
> ![filter_tb_logs](./pics/filter_tb_logs.png)

## Unofficial implementations

We made some unofficial implementations of the previous work. No more "[coming soon](https://archive.is/6gA9Y)", plz!   
(ಥ皿ಥ) 

### ADBA

Implemented in [`reprod_modules/adba`](./src/reprod_modules/adba/).  

* Paper: [Anti-distillation backdoor attacks: Backdoors can really survive in knowledge distillation](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3474085.3475254)  

### SCAR

Implemented in [`reprod_modules/scar`](./src/reprod_modules/scar/).  

* Note that because this work is **computationally very expensive** and difficult to tune, this implementation is incomplete and may contain some errors. It is provided for reference only. 
* Paper: [Taught Well Learned Ill: Towards Distillation-conditional Backdoor Attack](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.23871)  
* (2025.11.17) Glad to see they finally released their official code: https://github.com/WhitolfChen/SCAR  

### Neural Cleanse

Implemented in [`defense_modules/neural_cleanse.py`](./src/defense_modules/neural_cleanse.py). 

* Paper: [Neural Cleanse: Identifying and Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Neural Networks](https://bolunwang.github.io/assets/docs/backdoor-sp19.pdf)  

### SCALE-UP

Implemented in [`defense_modules/scale_up.py`](./src/defense_modules/scale_up.py).  

* We still adopt the Z-Score normalization used in [the official impl](https://github.com/THUYimingLi/BackdoorBox/blob/main/core/defenses/SCALE_UP.py), but followed the original paper's idea more closely by calculating the *mean* and *std* class-wise. Additionally, we correct potential biases regarding the calculation of statistics for benign samples.  
* Paper: [Scale-up: An efficient black-box input-level backdoor detection via analyzing scaled prediction consistency](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03251)  

### STRIP

Implemented in [`defense_modules/strip.py`](./src/defense_modules/strip.py).  

* Following the [official implementation](https://github.com/garrisongys/STRIP/blob/master/STRIP_CIFAR10DeepArchit_Tb.ipynb), but in a more parallel manner.  
* Paper: [STRIP: A defence against trojan attacks on deep neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06531)
